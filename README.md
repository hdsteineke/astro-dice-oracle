# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

- My first goal today is to see if I can successfully fetch a horoscope object from supabase to display in the saved horoscopes section


8/7/2024

- Successfully fetch horoscope data from Supabase
- successfully create horoscope data from app webpage


- As much as I thought I could get away with coding in my App.js just to get some momentum, I am quickly realizing the error of my ways and remember why components and architecture are so fundamentally important to working code... blahh

I think my goal today is to style my app a little bit to get it feeling closer to my vision. I want to:
1) format the containers holding the horoscopes 
2) give the webpage a little color

I didn't get to color yet; I think I'll wait until I have the structure I want before I start down that rabbit hole of styling

9/4/24
Today I would like to work on setting up another route where I can designate the saved horoscopes, so that they are not all on the landing page. Then we'll go from there.

9/25/24
Today my goals are to:
1) keep fortune template clear until dice have been rolled
2) clear horocope template upon saving to journal
3) make horoscopes editable, updatable, and deletable
